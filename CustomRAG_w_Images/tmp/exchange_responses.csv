of trials comparing more- vs. less-intensive LDL-C lowering with
statins indicated that more-intensive statin therapy produced
greater reductions in the risks of cardiovascular death, non-fatal
MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularization.°°° For every
1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, these further reductions in risk
were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statins
vs. control. Therefore, statins are recommended in all patients
with AMI, irrespective of cholesterol concentration at presenta-
tion. Lipid-lowering treatment should be started as early as possi-
ble, as this increases patient adherence after discharge, and given
as high-intensity treatment, as this is associated with early and sus-
tained clinical benefits.* The intensity of statin therapy should be
increased in those receiving a low- or moderate-intensity statin
treatment at presentation, unless they have a history of intoler-
ance to high-intensity statin therapy or other characteristics that
may influence safety.*°°°°° The treatment goal is an LDL-C con-
centration of < 1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) or at least 50% reduction
in LDL-C if the baseline LDL-C level is 1.8-3.5 mmol/L.4°°7?°?
The use of lower-intensity statin therapy should be considered in
patients at increased risk of side effects from statins (e.g. elderly,
hepatic or renal impairment, previous side effects, or a potential
for interaction with essential concomitant therapy). Following MI,
the lipid profile goes through phasic changes, with small reduc-
tions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C, and increases in tri-
glycerides within the first 24h.°”°°”"" A lipid profile should be
obtained as early as possible after admission for STEMI and can be
non-fasting, as total and HDL-C show little diurnal variation and
LDL-C variation is within 10%.°”* Lipids should be re-evaluated
4-6 weeks after the ACS to determine whether the target levels
have been reached and regarding safety issues; the lipid lowering
therapy can then be adjusted accordingly. Trial results with high
doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin°°°?’?°”> favour a high-
